### 1. Introduction
- **Purpose**: This Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP) is designed to ensure the successful development and maintenance of the 2.5D battler game project, focusing on cultivation mechanics and mercenary work. It will outline processes to maintain quality standards throughout development.
- **Scope**: The 2.5D battler game will be developed using C++, integrating a unique blend of cultivation and mercenary gameplay mechanics. The project includes features such as character progression, combat systems, and a semi-immersive 2.5D environment.

### 2. Definitions
- **2.5D**: A game design style that combines two-dimensional gameplay with three-dimensional elements for visual depth.
- **Cultivation**: A gameplay mechanic focusing on character growth through training, skill enhancement, and resource management.
- **Mercenary Work**: Missions or tasks completed for rewards, often involving combat or strategy.

### 3. References
- **Reference 1**: Project contract for the development of the 2.5D battler game.
- **Reference 2**: IEEE 730-2014 Standard for Software Quality Assurance Plans.
